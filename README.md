# Kenshi-Online

**16-player co-op multiplayer mod for Kenshi**

Kenshi-Online adds seamless multiplayer to Kenshi using native MyGUI integration, ENet networking, and Ogre plugin injection. Players can explore, fight, build, and trade together in the open world of Kenshi.

## Features

- **Up to 16 players** on a single server
- **Dedicated server** with persistence and console commands
- **Master server** with centralized server browser (auto-discovery)
- **Full network replication** - characters, NPCs, combat, buildings, items
- **Zone-based sync** - efficient bandwidth usage with interest management
- **Server-authoritative** combat and world state
- **Native MyGUI HUD** - status bar, chat with timestamps, player list, debug log
- **Client commands** - `/tp`, `/time`, `/kick`, `/announce`, `/connect`, `/disconnect`, `/pos`, `/players`, `/status`, `/entities`, `/ping`, `/debug`, `/help`
- **Just launch and play** - Ogre plugin injection, no manual setup

## Architecture

```
KenshiMP.Injector.exe    -> Modifies Plugins_x64.cfg, launches Kenshi
KenshiMP.Core.dll        -> Loaded by Ogre as a plugin, hooks game functions
KenshiMP.Server.exe      -> Dedicated server (host on VPS or locally)
KenshiMP.MasterServer.exe-> Centralized server browser registry (port 27801)
KenshiMP.Common.lib      -> Shared types, protocol, serialization
KenshiMP.Scanner.lib     -> Pattern scanning, MinHook wrapper
```

## Quick Start

### Player
1. Build the solution (see Building below)
2. Run `KenshiMP.Injector.exe`
3. Set your player name and server address
4. Click **PLAY**
5. Kenshi launches with multiplayer enabled

### Server (Local or VPS)
1. Copy `KenshiMP.Server.exe` to your VPS
2. Create `server.json` (or let it generate defaults):
```json
{
  "serverName": "My Kenshi Server",
  "port": 27800,
  "maxPlayers": 16,
  "pvpEnabled": true,
  "gameSpeed": 1.0
}
```
3. Run: `./KenshiMP.Server.exe`
4. Forward port **27800 UDP** on your router/firewall
5. Players connect via your IP address or the server browser

### Server Commands
```
status   - Show server info
players  - List connected players
kick <id> - Kick a player
say <msg> - Broadcast system message
save     - Save world state
stop     - Shutdown server
```

## Building

### Requirements
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or 2019) with **Desktop development with C++** workload
- **CMake 3.20+** ([download](https://cmake.org/download/) or `winget install Kitware.CMake`)
- **Git** (for submodules)

No vcpkg needed -- all dependencies are bundled as git submodules.

### One-Click Build

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/muddxyii/Kenshi-Online.git
cd Kenshi-Online
build.bat
```

That's it for most Steam installs. `build.bat` detects your Visual Studio version, finds Kenshi in common Steam library folders, configures CMake, builds all targets, and runs unit tests.

If Kenshi is installed somewhere custom, pass the folder that contains `kenshi_x64.exe`:

```bash
build.bat "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Kenshi"
```

You can also set `KENSHI_DIR` for the current terminal before building:

```bash
set KENSHI_DIR=D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Kenshi
build.bat
```

### Open in Visual Studio

**Option A -- CMake native (recommended):**
1. Open Visual Studio 2022
2. File > Open > CMake...
3. Select `CMakeLists.txt` in the project root
4. VS reads `CMakePresets.json` and configures automatically
5. Select **x64-release** preset from the toolbar
6. Build > Build All (Ctrl+Shift+B)

**Option B -- Solution file:**
```bash
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
start build\KenshiMP.sln
```
Set configuration to **Release** and build.

### Manual (Command Line)

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/muddxyii/Kenshi-Online.git
cd Kenshi-Online

# If you forgot --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Configure
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DKENSHI_DIR:PATH="D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Kenshi"

# Build
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run tests
build\bin\Release\KenshiMP.UnitTest.exe
```

### Output

```
build/bin/Release/
    KenshiMP.Core.dll           # Client plugin (auto-deployed to Kenshi dir)
    KenshiMP.Server.exe         # Dedicated server (auto-deployed to Kenshi dir)
    KenshiMP.Injector.exe       # Launcher / installer
    KenshiMP.MasterServer.exe   # Server browser registry
    KenshiMP.TestClient.exe     # Fake player for testing
    KenshiMP.IntegrationTest.exe
    KenshiMP.UnitTest.exe
```

### Dependencies (bundled as submodules in `lib/`)

## Technical Details

### Injection Method
Uses the Ogre3D plugin system (proven by RE_Kenshi). The injector modifies
`Plugins_x64.cfg` to add `Plugin=KenshiMP.Core`, and Ogre loads our DLL
automatically during engine initialization. No process injection or manual
DLL loading required.

### Pattern Scanner
Scans kenshi_x64.exe in-memory using IDA-style byte patterns with wildcards.
Resolves RIP-relative addresses for x64 code. Falls back to known pointer chains
from Cheat Engine community.

### State Synchronization
- **Entity ownership**: Each player owns their squad; server owns NPCs
- **Interpolation**: 100ms buffer with hermite spline for smooth remote movement
- **Zone interest**: 3x3 zone grid around each player (only sync nearby entities)
- **Delta compression**: float16 position deltas, smallest-three quaternion encoding
